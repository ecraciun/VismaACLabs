*FYI: [Known issues with .NET Core in Visual Studio 2017](https://github.com/aspnet/Tooling/blob/master/known-issues-vs2017.md)*

*More FYI: just for the fun of it, see below how many SEPARATE things you had to install if we would have continued with VS2015 :)*
- ~~Visual Studio 2015 Community or Professional Edition with Update 3 (https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=691978&clcid=0x409)~~
- ~~Latest Azure SDK (2.9.6 current) (https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=518003&clcid=0x409)~~
- ~~SQL Server Data Tools for VS2015 (https://msdn.microsoft.com/mt186501)~~
- ~~.NET Core tools preview for Visual Studio (1.0.1 tools Preview 2 current) (https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=827546)~~
- ~~latest version of Nuget package manager (https://www.nuget.org/)~~

### Setup
- open solution in VS
- CTRL + Q and search for Package Manager Console
- once opened select the Data project as the default project (second dropdown)
- run the following command: 
```
Update-Database
```
- expand the src > CloudStorage > Dependencies nodes, right click on the Bower folder and click on Restore Packages
- *or as an alternative for the above step, open up the CloudStorage project folder in Command Prompt (make sure the bower.json file is in that folder) and type in the following command: bower install*
- **make sure to start the Microsoft Azure Storage Emulator before running the application (use windows search to find it)**
- that's it, just make sure the CloudStorage project is selected as the default one, hit F5 and enjoy! (VS should restore all missing packages automatically)

**Note: this will NOT be deployable to Linux because of it's dependency to WindowsAzure.Storage nuget package**
